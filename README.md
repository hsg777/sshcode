`sshcode` is a CLI to automatically install and run [code-server](https://github.com/cdr/code-server) over SSH.

It uploads your extensions and settings automatically, so you can seamlessly use
remote servers as [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) hosts.

If you have Chrome installed, it opens the browser in app mode. That means
there's no keybind conflicts, address bar, or indication that you're coding within a browser.
**It feels just like native VS Code.**

## Install

**Have Chrome installed for the best experience.**

Install with `go`:

```bash
go get -u go.coder.com/sshcode
```

Or, grab a [pre-built binary](https://github.com/cdr/sshcode/releases).

### OS Support

We currently support:
- Linux
- MacOS
- WSL

For the remote server, we currently only support Linux `x86_64` (64-bit)
servers with `glibc`. `musl` libc (which is most notably used by Alpine Linux)
is currently not supported on the remote server:
[#122](https://github.com/cdr/sshcode/issues/122).

## Usage

```bash
sshcode kyle@dev.kwc.io
# Starts code-server on dev.kwc.io and opens in a new browser window.
```

You can specify a remote directory as the second argument:

```bash
sshcode kyle@dev.kwc.io "~/projects/sourcegraph"
```

## Extensions & Settings Sync

By default, `sshcode` will `rsync` your local VS Code settings and extensions
to the remote server every time you connect.

This operation may take a while on a slow connections, but will be fast
on follow-up connections to the same server.

To disable this feature entirely, pass the `--skipsync` flag.

### Custom settings directories

If you're using an alternate release of VS Code such as VS Code Insiders, you
must specify your settings directories through the `VSCODE_CONFIG_DIR` and
`VSCODE_EXTENSIONS_DIR` environment variables.

The following will make `sshcode` work with VS Code Insiders:

**MacOS**

```bash
export VSCODE_CONFIG_DIR="$HOME/Library/Application Support/Code - Insiders/User"
export VSCODE_EXTENSIONS_DIR="$HOME/.vscode-insiders/extensions"
```

**Linux**

```bash
export VSCODE_CONFIG_DIR="$HOME/.config/Code - Insiders/User"
export VSCODE_EXTENSIONS_DIR="$HOME/.vscode-insiders/extensions"
```

### Sync-back

By default, VS Code changes on the remote server won't be synced back
when the connection closes. To synchronize back to local when the connection ends,
pass the `-b` flag.
